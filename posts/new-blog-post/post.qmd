Welcome to our blog!

At this blog, we're excited to share our hiking and other adventures with you. We are Lizel and Rasmus, based in Sweden and Denmark. Most of our trips take place in Sweden, but in the future, we're eager to explore many other places too.<br>
 <br>
A little about us: Lizel is a bioinformatician at a university in southern Sweden, while I am currently studying multimedia design in Denmark. Before this change, I've had diverse experiences, including customer service, forestry, wilderness guiding, and working as an Operations Associate at an insurance company.<br>
 <br>
Our interests are wide-ranging, and aside from hiking and camping, we also enjoy festivals, gigs, urban exploration, board games, and playing with technology. These shared passions have inspired us to start this blog.<br>
 <br>
If you stick around, we'll be sharing content about our hiking routes, valuable map resources, orienteering games, gear recommendations, upcoming adventures, and so much more.<br>
 <br>
We're thrilled to have you join us on this journey, and we look forward to connecting with fellow adventurers and technology enthusiasts. Let's embark on exciting experiences together!<br>
