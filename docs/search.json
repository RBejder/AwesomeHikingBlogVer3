    "text": "This is my first post in this Quarto blog. Welcome!  \nWelcome to our blog\nThe idea of this blog is simply to share our hiking and other adventures. We are Lizel and Rasmus, located in Sweden and Denmark. Most of our trips are, and will be happening, in Sweden. But in the future, we are very likely to explore many other places. Lizel is a bioinformatician at a university in south Sweden and i am studying multimedia design in Denmark. Before this change i have also worked with customer service, forestry, wilderness guiding, and Iâ€™ve been an Operations Associate at an insurance company. Our interests range far and wide, aside from hiking and camping we enjoy festivals, gigs, urban exploration board games and playing with technology which is also one of the reasons to start this blog. If you stick around, we are likely to talk about our hiking routs, map resources, some orienteering games, gear, upcoming adventures and probably many other things."
