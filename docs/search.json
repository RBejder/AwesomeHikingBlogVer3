Welcome!\n  \nThe purpose of this blog is to share hiking trips, gear, trails, pictures, orienteering games etc. At first, primarily in Sweden but in the future anything is posible. At the moment we are preparing for the, more than, 400km long hike of Kungsleden (Kingâ€™s Trail) in north sweden. So far the plan is to do this in 2024"
